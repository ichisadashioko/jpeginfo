Jpeginfo v1.7.1beta  Copyright (c) 1995-2023, Timo Kokkonen.


REQUIREMENTS
	Independent JPEG Group's jpeg library (libjpeg) version 6b or later.
	(Alternatively should also work with libjpeg-turbo or mozjpeg)

TESTED PLATFORMS
	Linux
	MacOS
	Solaris
        IRIX
	HP-UX

INSTALLATION
	Installation should be very straightforward, just unpack the
	tar file, run configure script, and then compile the program.
	You may want to do something like this:

		gunzip -c jpeginfo-1.7.0.tar.gz | tar xf -
		cd jpeginfo-1.7.0
		./configure
		make
		make strip
		make install

	NOTE! if 'configure' cannot find libjpeg.a or jpeglib.h, then
	you must use the --with-jpeglib option when running configure,
	see 'configure --help'.


HISTORY
	v1.7.1 - add --files-from and --files-stdin,
	         minor fixed.
        v1.7.0 - support for CSV output (--csv),
	         support for JSON output (--json),
	         add support for reading input file from stdin (--stdin),
		 add support for displaying column names (--header),
		 add SHA-512 sigest support (--sha512),
	         other minor fixes.
	v1.6.2 - add SHA-256 digest support (--sha256 or -2),
	         improved Win32 support thanks to tumagonx,
		 other minor fixes.
	v1.6.1 - support for new libjpeg v7 thanks to Guido Vollbeding,
		 fix to display of 8bit characters by Pierre Jarillon
	v1.6.0 - added support for printing out Comments (from COM
	         markers), Exif format images are now also recognized
	         (no Exif marker decoding functionality, though).
	v1.5   - configuration is now done with GNU autoconf,
		 program now uses free MD5 algorithm,
		 added file size as new field on reports,
		 program now returns exit code 1 if one or more of the jpegs
		 had any errors, useful for testing if particular jpeg is
	         ok from shell scripts,
	         also if you specify -q (--quiet) option twice on
		 command line, then program won't produce any output.
	v1.4   - added support for calculating MD5 checksums.
	v1.3   - alternative listing format (-l switch) added.
	         new column on reports displaying whether jpeg is
		 progressive or normal (P/N).
		 new switch -i for printing out even more information
	         about pictures: coding, density, CCIR601 sampling.
	         new switch -f for passing filenames to program from
	         file or stdin.
	v1.2   - improved support for other platforms, minor fixes
        v1.1.2 - small fixes, improvements to Makefile
